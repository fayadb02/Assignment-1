               <h2>Upbringing and Career</h2>
            <p id= "para1" ><strong>Rodarius Marcell</strong> <em>Rod Wave</em> Green, known by his stage name Rod Wave, was born on August 27, 1998, in St. Petersburg, Florida. His childhood and adolescent years started off with a few bumps along the road. 
            When he was in elementary school, Wave’s parents had a divorce. To add to it, his father went to jail. With his family not being able to support him, he turned to the streets to make money for himself. 
            Wave found himself going in and out of juvenile centers, being involved with several illegal activities including dealing drugs, robbing, breaking into homes, and illegal possession of firearms. Wave’s father, 
            later on, got out of jail and quickly realized the type of lifestyle his son was leading. In an effort to guide him in the right direction, his father encouraged him to pursue music, something that Wave had 
            an interest in since an early age. He bought him a microphone while his brother bought him a computer. With these, Wave was given the tools he needed to turn his life around. he started experimenting with the
            equipment given to him and released a few mixtapes. At first, he only saw it as a hobby and a way to keep himself off the streets. To his surprise, he started getting local buzz, showing him that there was potential
            in his music. Soon after, he signed with Alamo Records, where he started collaborating with big artists such as Moneybagg Yo. In 2019 he released his mixtape “PTSD,” in which the single ‘Heart on Ice’ became a viral 
            sensation on TikTok and other social media platforms. The song achieved commercial success, getting co-signs from big names, including 21 Savage and Meek Mill. Keeping the momentum going, Wave proceeded to release his 
            first studio album, “Ghetto Gospel,” in the same year (2019). The following year, Wave released his second studio album, “Pray 4 Love,” which entered the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100 charts. A lot of artists use 
            collaborations to push their album sales. But Wave chose not to feature anyone in this second project. He did so because the album was very personal for him, which is evident in his vulnerable vocal delivery throughout
            the work. Beneath the lush instrumentation and hard-hitting drums, there was a pain in his voice as he recalled many memories of his past. From one project to another, Wave proved himself as not just a rapper or singer
            but also a storyteller. He focuses on lyrics above all else as he always wants to shed more light on the theme of his songs, which are mostly about everyday struggles. His songs are relatable, speaking to people who feel
            lost in the world. Wave never really speaks about his personal life outside his music. Through social media, he lets his fans take a peek into his personal life, without trying to incite scandals or drama.
